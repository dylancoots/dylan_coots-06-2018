### Communication
Dear [client name],

This is Dylan from Midwestern Interactive and I am contacting you because I need some more information for the 'About Us'
page of this site project. The project is coming along great; however, this page would benefit from some more 
photos. These can be photos of your business, your employees, your work, etc. The page could also benefit from a few 
paragraphs that describe your business. These paragraphs should contain information that describes your business, what 
you're about, your goals, etc. 

Should you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact me or our project manager.

Thank you,

Dylan Coots


### Code Test

I was able to get most of the code test requirements completed. I haven't been using html/css/js all that much with my current job so I spent some time refreshing my memory. I picked back up on it quickly (last time I did web dev. was a few years ago) and I got most of it done to the best of my ability. Aside from having difficulty remembering some of the 'gotchas' of html/css, this wasn't all that bad. 

Edit: At the time of submission, I realized that I missed adding the logo to the header of the page. Adding now.
